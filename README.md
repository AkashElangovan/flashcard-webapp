# MERN Flash Card App with SM2 Algorithm

## Overview

This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application is a simple flash card app that utilizes the SM2 algorithm for spaced repetition. The SM2 algorithm is a widely used algorithm for optimizing the timing of reviewing flashcards, ensuring efficient and effective learning.

## Features

- **User authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and securely manage their flash cards.
- **Flash Card Creation**: Users can create flash cards with questions and answers.
- **SM2 Algorithm**: The app implements the SM2 algorithm for spaced repetition to optimize the timing of flash card reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing flash cards and user data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling server-side logic.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
